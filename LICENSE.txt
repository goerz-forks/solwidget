All source files are clearly marked at the top as to the license
that applies to them.

The original Sol version 1.2.3 sources are licensed under a BSD
3-clause style license.  Many files in the Sol project continue to
use this license INCLUDING the raw database dump (i.e. the
database_values.txt and database_make_sql files) and ALL the image
files (including the .psd files).

The original Sol version 1.2.3 source release license can be found
in the file OLDLICENSE.txt.

When Dan released the Sol version 1.2.3 source code, he referred
to the license as an MIT license and in fact the original README
file included with the Sol version 1.2.3 source code release says
the code is licensed under the MIT license which can be found in
the LICENSE file (included here as the OLDLICENSE.txt file).  However,
the license text from that file actually matches the text of the
modified BSD (aka 3-clause BSD) license, not the MIT license.  See
http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#ModifiedBSD for
comparison.

The new source code files that were added to create, read and write
the special compact-format database now included in the Sol widget
are licensed under the GPLv3.  Since these code files are built
into the TimeZoneHelper and that is an essential part of the Sol.wdgt
combined work, the resulting Sol.wdgt falls under the GPLv3 license.

The GPLv3 license can be found in the file COPYING.txt.
